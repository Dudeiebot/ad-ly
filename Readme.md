# 🔗 Link Shortener - High-Level System Design (Inspired by Bitly)

This project outlines a **higher-level system design** of a URL shortener service similar to [Bitly](https://bitly.com)

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this system is to **convert long URLs into short, unique, and retrievable aliases** (short links). It should support:

- Generating short URLs
- Redirecting to original URLs
- Handling high scale and concurrency
- Providing analytics (optionally)

## 🏗️ High-Level Components

### 1. API Layer

- `POST /shorten` – Accepts a long URL, returns a short URL.
- `GET /:shortCode` – Redirects to the original long URL.

### 2. URL Encoding Service

- Generates a unique short code for each URL.
- Can use Base62 encoding or a hash function.
- Handles collisions (retry mechanism or add suffix).

### 3. Database

- Stores mappings: `shortCode <-> longURL`
- May also store metadata like:
  - Creation date
  - Expiry date
  - Click count

### 4. Caching Layer

- Frequently accessed short links are cached (with Redis).
- Reduces database load and speeds up redirects.

### 5. Analytics & Logging (Optional)

- Collects data such as:
  - Number of redirects
  - Geolocation
  - Timestamps
- Can be used for dashboards and monitoring.

## 🔒 Security & Integrity

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Option to expire or delete links.
- Detection of spam or malicious URLs.

## Enhancements

- Custom short codes (e.g., `bit.ly/my-link`)
- User accounts and link history
- QR code generation
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Go
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache:** Redis
